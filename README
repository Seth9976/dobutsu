Ideas for compact representation in the database:

+---+ The sente lion has five squares to be on: If the lion is on A,
|AAA| he has already won, so this can't happen.  If he's on B, we can
|BCX| mirror the board. When he's on C, there is no way to place the
|BXX| Gote lion so this can't be the case.
|BXX|
+---+

The Gote lion has up to seven squares. When he's in the opponents
promotion zone A he is either in check (in which case the position is
invalid) or has already won. When he's on B, he is in check by Sente
which makes the position invalid. This leaves 7 + 6 + 5 + 3 + 3 = 24
positions for the lions:

+---+ +---+ +---+ +---+ +---+
|XXX| |XXX| |XXX| |XXX| |XBB|
|XXX| |XXX| |XBB| |BBB| |XBL|
|XBB| |BBB| |XBL| |BLB| |XBB|
|AAL| |ALA| |AAA| |AAA| |AAA|
+---+ +---+ +---+ +---+ +---+

The remaining pieces have up to 11 positions: up to ten free squares or
in the hand of the player.  Requiring the first piece to be on a higher
square than the second for parity, this gives 56 positions for each pair
of pieces (9 + 8 + ... + 1 and 1 for both pieces being in hand).

The ownership and promotion byte is defined as follows:

0: owned by gote
1: owned by sente

0: unpromoted (chick)
1: promoted (rooster)

We require a chick in hand to be not promoted to remove a couple more
positions from the file.  Lastly, if Gote's lion is in check Sente has
already won so we don't have to store these positions in the table.

Altogether we get:

256 * 24 * 56 * 56 * 56 = 1078984704 positions.

If we have one byte per position, that's an endgame file of 1 Gigabyte.

Only 126109799 positions are neither invalid nor already won or lost, so
88.31% of the space is wasted.  It's hard to make a better index format
without making it very complicated.

For example, the starting position looks like this:

    +---+
    |elg| 0xA8B2A3C185
    | c |
    | C |
    |GLE|
    +---+

Board visualization:

Capital letter means owned by sente, lower-case letter is owned by gote.  Pieces:

L/l: lion
E/e: elephant
G/g: giraffe
C/C: chick
R/r: rooster

Pieces in hand are placed to the right of the board, like this:

    +---+
    | lg| c
    | e |
    |   |
    |GLE| C
    +---+

Second level compression:

The actual endgame file uses a two stage encoding, the first stage being
listed above.  For the second stage, the index is grouped into buckets
of 4096 indices.  Invalid entries are removed from each bucket, the
reduced buckets are stored in the index file.  A table stores where each
bucket begins.  To find a given position, you look up the beginning of
the bucket in the table and then compute the offset where your position
is by checking how many indices before yours are invalid.
